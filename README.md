ierelated -> IETLS related
this project as you may guess is related to IELTS.
it is a simulation of ielts but this test is not held so, this project was just done to practice this test sometimes on my own PC, but it became an idea later and i extended it even futher.

the second one -> main project:
these are some of the projects i've worked on before, but these are just my knowledge about python, I also worked with some important AI libraries and modules like: Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas,
scikit-learn and so on.
